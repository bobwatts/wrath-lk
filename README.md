Initial Commit. Worked on this project from December 2023-January 2024.
Basic functionality roughly implemented, including:
 - automated board setup
 - turn-based gameplay
 - outputs for relevant game info for each turn
 - automated board upkeep
 - card and action resolution is automated
 - rule upkeep (only legal actions are available)

Currently in debug stage. Afterwards, my next steps would be to add the more 
niche functionalites such as quest reward card abilities and special hero 
abilities.

Future steps/directions to take this project:
 - Create a better interface, either using a website, tilesets, or colored ascii
characters.
 - Add an ability to save/load games
 - Allow a computer to host a game so other computers can join on a local 
 network
